## Countdown Timer
A simple Android app that uses **ViewModel** and **LiveData** to provide timer functionality.

Set the time and hit start to begin the countdown. Features include:
- `pause`/ `resume` / `cancel` the timer while it is running.
- `restart` / `dismiss` the timer once it is finished.
